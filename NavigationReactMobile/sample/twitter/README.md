# Navigation Mobile Twitter
Navigation brings native-like navigation to the web. Use it with React to create PWAs.

## Run
Once you've cloned the repository, you can install the dependencies and start the Twitter example:

    npm install
    npm run build

Then open app.html to see it in action. Click Hyperlinks and watch scenes animate in and out. Navigate back, with either browser history or the arrow, and see that scenes are restored exactly as they were, for example, it retains the scroll position.
