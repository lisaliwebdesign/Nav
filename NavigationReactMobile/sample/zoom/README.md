# Navigation Mobile Zoom
Navigation lets you share elements between scenes. The SharedElementMotion component gives you control over how they animate.

## Run
Once you've cloned the repository, you can install the dependencies and start the Zoom example:

    npm install
    npm run build

Then open app.html to see Navigation Zoom in action. Select a color and watch it zoom into position on the next scene. It changes shape and the accompanying text changes font-size and color.
