# Navigation Redux
Navigation doesn't own your components so it integrates well with other libraries, like Redux.  

## Run
Once you've cloned the repository, you can install the dependencies and start the Redux example:

    npm install
    npm run build

Then open app.html to see Navigation Redux in action. Edit a person's name to dispatch an action and update the store.
